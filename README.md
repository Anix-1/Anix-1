# Hey there! I'm Anurag Rout 👋

I'm an undergraduate student studying **Computer Science** with a focus on **Data Science and Analytics** at **@JECRC University**. I'm collaborating with **@Samatrix.io**, where I'm constantly learning and working on real-world data projects. I'm passionate about using data to tell stories and solve problems.

## What I Do:
- 🔍 **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights and creating visualizations using Python, SQL, and Excel.
- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Diving deep into datasets to uncover patterns and trends.
- 💻 **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models to help businesses make data-driven decisions.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Using tools like Tableau and Power BI to make data come to life.

## Currently Exploring:
- 🚀 **Machine Learning** techniques (and how they can be applied to real-world problems)
- 🧠 **Deep Learning** (looking forward to exploring TensorFlow and PyTorch)
- 🔧 **Data Pipelines**: Automating data workflows for better efficiency
